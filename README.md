## PROJECT OVERVIEW 

This project involves analyzing transactional order data from a fictional restaurant—the “Taste of the World Café”—using two interconnected Excel tables: Order Details and Menu Items (Menu Item). 

This analysis answers key business questions about sales performance, item popularity, customer trends, and revenue, culminating in an interactive dashboard and pivot table report. 

 ## Dataset Structure 

**Order Details** sheet includes: 

Order ID (unique for each transaction) 

Order Date & Order Time 

Item ID (links to Menu Items) 

**Menu Items** sheet includes: 

Menu Item ID (same as Item ID) 

Item Name (e.g., Hamburger, Hot Dog) 

Category (American, Asian, Mexican, Italian) 

Price (e.g., 12.95, 13.95, 9.00, 10.50) 

## Data Preparation & Cleaning 

Verified column names match exactly between tables. 

Ensured date and time fields were formatted correctly. 

Merged the two tables in Excel to map each order to its item details (price, category).

Order day, Order month, Order year was created from the Order date 

## Analytical Questions Answered (via Pivot Tables and Excel Dashboard) 

Total number of orders 

Total number of items ordered 

Count of categories represented 

Total revenue generated 

Most and least ordered items 

Revenue and breakdown by category 

Peak order times (e.g., morning vs evening) 

## Dashboard Highlights 

**Summary cards** for total revenue, order counts, and average order value 

**Pivot visualizations** showing: 

Top‑selling and bottom‑selling menu items 

Revenue by category (American, Asian, Mexican, Italian) 

Order frequency across different times of day 

**Interactive filters** to explore data by category, item, or order date 

## Key Insights 

**Most ordered items**: Hamburger led popularity; least: Chicken Tacos. 

**Category trends:** Italian and Asian items dominate in sales and order volume; Mexican and Italian perform moderately. 

**Revenue drivers:** High-order counts combined with mid-to-high price points generate majority revenue. 

## Recommendations 

**Promote high-performing items** like hamburgers during peak hours to boost revenue. 

**Revise or bundle** low-performing items (e.g., tacos or lasagna) to improve sales. 

**Offer cross-category combo deals** (e.g., burger + fries, Asian entrée + drink) during peak times. 

**Monitor category performance** regularly and adjust menu offerings based on demand patterns.
